# üìù Latex Templates for University/Research

Latex templates that I use for my university and research work. This is combined with VSCode extension [Blueprint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teamchilla.blueprint) by *teamchilia*. Because of this, most of the main `.tex`files are named `__snakeCase_name__.tex`.

Math commands in `preamble/__math__.sty` is a slight modification of Paschal Michaillat's [repository](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math) with a complete guide described [here](https://pascalmichaillat.org/d3/).
